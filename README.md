# shiny-statistics-apps
Everyone knows that statistic is not easy to learn and the best method is to learn it empirically. This is why I decided to do a serie of 
statistic apps in Shiny (R).

## Requirements:
- R
- Shiny
- ggplot2

## Avaiable apps:
- Central limit theorem
- Guess the correlation

## Example:
